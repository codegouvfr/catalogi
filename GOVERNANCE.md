Functionalities implemented in this application are decided by DINUM, which is the main user of the application for the [Socle interminist√©riel de logiciels libres](https://code.gouv.fr/sill).

With the aim of creating a catalogue for research software, French researchers are exchanging ideas with DINUM to make the application generic enough for this other catalogue.

These informal exchanges do not require any particular governance. However, for the sake of transparency, all decisions concerning developments to the application will be discussed publicly in issues.
