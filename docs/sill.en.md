## Why this catalogue?

The Interministerial Free Software Catalog (aka SILL for "socle interministériel de logiciels libres" in French) is the reference catalogue of free software recommended by the French government for use throughout the public sector.

This catalogue helps government departments find their way around the Free Software they are encouraged to use, in accordance with [article 16 of the law for a digital Republic](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/article_lc/LEGIARTI000033205068):

> ‘The administrations mentioned in the first paragraph of Article L. 300-2 of the Code of Relations between the Public and the Administration shall ensure that their information systems remain under control, sustainable and independent. They shall encourage the use of free software and open formats when developing, purchasing or using all or part of these information systems.

It is published by the [Free Software unit](https://code.gouv.fr) of the ([DINUM](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr)) on the website [code.gouv.fr/sill](https://code.gouv.fr/sill). It is built in a collaborative way by a community of public servants who propose themselves as referents, technical experts or not, or declare themselves users. These public servants may be from the three civil services: the State, hospitals and local authorities.

If you have any questions, you can write to the Free Software unit that leads this community: <sill@code.gouv.fr>

## Criteria for inclusion of Free Software in the catalog

For a Free Software to be included in this catalog:

- Its source code must be published under one of the [accepted Free Software licences](https://code.gouv.fr/fr/doc/licences-libres-dinum/), with no delay between publication of the source code and publication of the executable files.
- It must be deployed by the IT department of a public institution or installed by a public employee on his or her workstation.

Free Software used as *Software as a Service* may be referenced provided that the administration is technically or administratively in charge of the servers where the software is deployed.

Several software packages with similar functionalities may be included in the SILL (see, for example, these [text editors](https://code.gouv.fr/sill/detail?name=GNU%20Emacs), or these [content management systems](https://code.gouv.fr/sill/detail?name=Drupal)): the SILL referents are working on developing the SILL so that this catalogue helps to choose between these multiple solutions.

## How do I add a Free Software to this catalog?

For software to be listed on this catalog, one or more public sector employees must volunteer to become *referrers* or *users*.

To become a referrer or user, create an account on [code.gouv.fr/sill](https://code.gouv.fr/sill). From there, you can either add a new free software application, or become a referrer or user of an existing free software application.

## How do I add a service provider to this catalog?

Do you represent a company offering services based on a Free Software from this catalog but are not listed as a service provider?

You can contact ADULLACT or the CNLL to join either the [Comptoir du libre](https://comptoir-du-libre.org/fr/) as a service provider or the [CNLL directory](https://annuaire.cnll.fr/).

Public-sector employees can open an account and contribute, but they cannot add a service provider themselves, so there is no need to ask them to do so.

## What does it mean to be a software ‘referent’?

### Who can be a ‘referent’?

**Any permanent or contractual civil servant** working in a public body in one of the three public services can be a referent for an Free Software package that they use on their workstation or are aware of using in their administration.

Referrers must register with their own e-mail address: functional addresses (such as sill@ministere.gouv.fr) are not permitted.

### What are the referee's tasks?

**The referee:**

1. certifies the use of free software in his/her administration or on his/her workstation;
2. helps to keep useful information about the software up to date (minimum recommended version, file, etc.);
3. agrees to be contacted by e-mail by other public servants registered on the [code.gouv.fr/sill](https://code.gouv.fr/sill) website;
4. look for a referrer to replace them if they are no longer able to
   act as referrer.
   
### Who has access to the referent for a software application?

Only people registered on [code.gouv.fr/sill](https://code.gouv.fr/sill) can access the emails of referents and users.
